# Range 10

## Description
Range 10 is a multipurpose range that can be used for AR/SCAR/AI/SEAD/PACKAGE/A-A training.


### AR / SCAR
In the northern part of the range are a AR zone (killbox). This AR tasking can be activated via F10 menu. (optional also to activate SAMs in support with the AR scenario. 
SAMs will be spawned in in accordance with the AR dynamic targets).

Activating this range will spawn in dynamicly targets for a AR tasking.

**AR Mission**
We have intelligence about enemy activity in the killbox (AR zone). Your mission is to conduct a AR mission in the AR zone.
Intelligence is that the enemy formation is located somewhere between 3 villages (Navpoints: T10.2 , T10.3 and T10.4 )
Task is to locate enemy targets in the killbox. Identify if the enemy formation is either:
1. Motorized infantry BN
2. Mechanized infantry BN
3. Armor BN
4. Regiment HQ
5. Rocket Artillery BN
6. Artillery BN
7. Logisitical BN

Once proper formation is identified, attack and neutralize the most important units in that formation.

High Value Target list:
1. Silkworm missile battery
2. MLRS rocket launcers

### AI
Target 10.1 is a target complex consisting of 2x storages and 2 x ammunition depots  

#### DPIs (Desired Point of Impacts)
- Storage NORTH: N22 48.817 E057 15.190 , elevation 1509ft
- Storage SOUTH: N22 48.761 E057 15.246, elevation 1509ft


### SEAD  
Target 10.1 is supported by a IADS system that can be activated via the F10 menu. You can select either easy, medium or hard.
Target 10.1 is protected by 4x SAM sites (1x SA-2, 1x SA-6, 1x SA-3, 1x SA-15) and a EWR.   Selecting either scenario will activate some of the SAMs working together in an IADS.

This can be used for either SEAD scenario training. It can also be used as SEAD in support of package training with AI beeing conducted against the target complex.
