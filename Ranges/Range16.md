# Range 16

## Description
Range 16 is a multipurpose range. Intended for : CAS / FAC(A) / JTAC / AR

Primary purpose is basic CAS training for JTACs.


## Basic Close Air Support Scenario
Enemy territory is to the WEST. Friendly territory to the EAST.
In the target area , a friendly motorized infantry platoon have encountered a stronger enemy force. Friendly forces are pinned down in a village
and surrounded by enemy forces to the NORTH, SOUTH and EAST.
Intelligence indicate that  enemy in the area is a motorized infantry company, supported by  mortar and a platoon of MBTs.
We have reportings of an enemy SA-9 5km WEST of friendly position IVO enemy mortar position.

Ground Force Commanders (GFC) intention for CAS: Support the friendly forces and provide CAS to neutralize high value targets

GFC priorities:
- Priority 1: Main Battle Tanks
- Priority 2: Infantry fighting vehicles
- Priority 3: Artillery / Mortars  (HOWEVER, IF MORTARS START FIRING, THEY ARE PRIORITY 1).

GFC have approved Type 1, Type 2 and Type 2 Airborne observer. Type 3. Is approved outside 1km of friendly forces.
Dange Close: GFC initials: H.M. For danger close attacks only Type 1 is approved. For Type one, only forward firing munitions approved (guns+rockets)

Friendly forces are supported by a mortar position further to the EAST.

Western military equipment is friendlies
Eastern military equipment is enemy forces

What you can see is what the scenario is. You will have friendly units on F10 map as you are able to communicate with friendly forces
and know where they are. Enemy units are hidden from the F10 map and you need to scan the target area to locate enemy forces.
