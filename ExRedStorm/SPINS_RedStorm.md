**Vertical separation.**
Receivers are to join from below and are to maintain a minimum of 1000ft vertical separation (unless otherwise directed by the controlling agency) , until visual contact have been made.

**Clearance.**
Receivers must receive clearance from the controlling agency (AWACS) before contacting the tanker.
