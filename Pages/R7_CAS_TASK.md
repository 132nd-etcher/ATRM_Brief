## Scenario
The Virtual Intelligence Service (VIS) have been able to identify and locate a outpost used by RED FORCES special operations forces.<br>
The outpost is located in the following grid: N23 52.350 E056 12.950<br>
Yesterday intelligence were able to intercept transmissions indicating a meeting taking place between the RED FORCE special forces commander present in the outpost, and a the leader of 31st Mechanized Regiment.<br>
<br>
It is assessed that the topic of the meeting is handover of information about BLUE FORCES positions along the FLOT, to identify weaknesses to be exploited by 31st Mechanized Regiment during the upcoming attack against Al Ain.<br>
The Commander of BLUE FORCES have assigned both Special Forces Commander and 31st Mechanized Regiment Commander as High Value Targets (HVT's) on the target list:
- HVT ALPHA: Special Forces Commander
- HVT BRAVO: 31st Mechanized Regiment Commander
<br>

During the cover of darkness last night, a  friendly special forces team was inserted into a hill roughly in grid: N23 55.100 E056 10.700. <br>
JTAC Warrior is part of this team, and are supporting effort to neutralize the targets.

## Admin
- Must be activated via F10 menu when CAS flight is checking in with JTAC. (JTAC / FAC(A) responsibility)
- Backup activation: Close to Al Bateen Airport, there are multiple vehicles. JTAC/FAC(A) will first activate the range scenario (activate units), but moving the veichle named:R7_CAS_VIP_Scenario_Activate into the windsock there.
Once CAS flight check-in, JTAC/FAC(A) will move the following vehicle R7_CAS_VIP_Scenario_Start into the windsock, and the scenario will start. 
- JTAC can be switched to a FAC(A) if not JTAC is availeble.
- If High Value Targets are encountered, these are priority 1 targets, and need to be taken out as soon as possible.
- Provide as much intelligence as possible after the mission in the after action review on the 132nd website (answering the intelligence questions).
- Provide good BDA in the after action review on the 132nd website .
