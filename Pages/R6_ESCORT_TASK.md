## Admin
- Convoy will start once a KA-50 is within 3000ft from the convoy (startlocation). (Currently there is no way of stopping the convoy. But can be implemented at a later stage, request through github issues)
- High Value Targets should be attacked immediatly if discovered.
- Civilian buildings within the killbox are part of the range complex, but are to be treated as civilian buildings (so minimze damage to civilian buildings)
- VBIEDs are simulated by single vehicles travelling at very high speed 
- Normal civilian traffic will travel at normal speeds (and should not be engaged)
